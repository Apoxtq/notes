### Main Themes
- No one designed the Internet, no one owns it, and no 
one can see across it all
> - 
   - It just grew and grew and grew . . . 
   - We try to make sense of it by imposing a structure 
(a series of layers) on it.
- The Internet is flawed and unreliable
   - So we have to be clever in how we use it.
- Designing applications for the Internet means making 
choices
   - And choices have consequences.
